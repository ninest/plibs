Dear __relative__,

I am having a __adjective__ time at camp. The counselour is __adjective__ and the food is __adjective__. I met __person_in_room__ and we became __adjective__ friends. Unfortunately, __person_in_room__ is __adjective__ and I __verb-ed__ my __body_part__ so we couldn't go __verb-ing__ like everybody else. I need more __noun-p__ and a __noun__ sharpener, so please __adverb__ __verb__ more when you __verb__ back.

Your __relative__,

__person_in_room__
